          <p>Finding an internship is never easy, especially when you are new to the field and have little experience.
            This post will give you tips and advices to look for an internship no matter your school year.</p>

          <p>Companies don't like risks. That's why they want to hire experienced students or students in their 3rd or
            4th year with the hope they will come back to work for the same company after graduating. However, lots of
            companies also love hiring smart, innovative individuals who will make an impact. This is what you need to
            prove! But how do you do it?</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">1. Side Projects</h2>

          <p>This is pretty much said by everyone already because it is the truth. Don't overthink your projects. Try to
            follow any tutorials you can find. If you overthink your projects, you might end up having a great idea but
            often time you waste a lot of time trying to just come up with the idea. You can make an Instagram clone,
            spin it in a cool way after. At that point, you have something to talk about when you meet a recruiter, for
            example, at an internship fair. Your projects also fill up the blank space of someone's resumes that don't
            have a lot of professional experience.</p>

          <p>Doing side projects is also a great way to fill up the skills section in your resume. If you Hadley applied
            to multiple companies before, you would have seen each company works with a different technology. It is
            advantageous to have as
            many skills as possible. However, make sure you actually have some experience with them, not just a little.
            It would look not so good when you're in an interview and the interviewer asks you about a skill you cannot
            even talk about at length.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">2. Participating in Hackathons</h2>

          <p>Many companies love hackathons. The pros of going to hackathons are: meeting companies' representatives;
            meeting other CS students; potentially making a cool project; potentially winning something. Having one or
            more hackathon awards on your resume will definitely catch the eyes of recruiters. Those awards show that
            you can work well in team; you are really innovative; and you are passionate about coding.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">3. Getting an interview</h2>

          <p>Many people struggle with just getting an interview. It is quite difficult because lots of companies will
            just filter out your resume if it does not have the school year the companies look for. However, do not lose
            hope. It is important to convince the companies that you have the experience and skills that many junior and
            above students don't have. How do you do it? Something that works for me is after each application, I find
            the company's recruiter or talent acquisitioner on a platform like LinkedIn.com. A free option without
            having a LinkedIn Premium subscription is to send a connect request with a note. The note section is
            300-character capped so it must have only your name, school, skills, achievements, projects. This method
            personally got me a good amount of interviews.
          </p>

          <p>Before Covid-19, internship fair is a great way to get noticed by companies. Typically colleges will host
            internship fairs once or twice a year. Companies spend their time and resource there for a reason: they want
            some interns. It is now your job to make both your and their life easier by convincing them that you're a
            potential candidate for the job. If you attend an intern fair, try to go talk to as many company
            representatives as possible: give a quick elevator speech about yourself and why you're a suitable candidate
            for the position; talk and get to know the company; and get someone's contact from the company, preferably a
            recruiter's. This is the most you can do to get yourself interviewed by the company.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">4. Preparing for an interview</h2>

          <p>There are mainly two types of interviews that you'll encounter in the search for an internship: a technical
            interview and a behavioral interview.</p>

          <p>For the technical interview, it is favorable to solve the questions successfully, passing all test cases.
            It is one of the most difficult tasks because these questions are not easy. To hopefully do well on any
            questions: it is recommended that you practice as many questions as possible. The main source of practice
            for most in this field will be <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>.</p>

          <p>The behavioral interview won't be as bad. Just be honest and sincere about your responses. This interview
            is to see your personality, especially whether you are equipped to work in a team and whether you would be a
            good worker.
          </p>

          <p>Good luck to everyone out there who is trying to find an internship. I hope this little post will be useful
            for you.
